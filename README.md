# Game Pricer

## Purpose
To give the program a name or a list of games and recieve them back with their respective grey market place value.

### Features
- The grey market place value will initally be the lowest but after version 1.0 could be specified to display the highest, mean. or median.

- The returned lists should be made into JSON files. The user can request just the JSON file or the data can be made into a formatted list via a .txt file.

- That list can then be sorted by the order it was given in, ascending or descending in price.
