# Game Pricer
A program that gives the user a list or chart of their spare PC game codes and their respective grey market place value.

### Features
- Take games from .txt file (games that are seperated by newlines) and give back a JSON file that has their grey market price listed. That JSON file can then be converted into a table that is saved to a .txt file.
- The table can be ordered from ascending, desending (in price) or left the way the games are given.
- Can find prices of individual games.

### To Do
- To see the mean of the first couple of listed prices. Or the lowest listed depending on if the amount of listings doesn't exceed a minimum. The option to only do the lowest listed should be avaiable.
- Have it exclude a lisitng based on the DRM of it (Steam/Epic Games Store/Rockstar Games Launcher/GOG/Ubisoft Launcher (UPlay)/EA Games Launcher)
